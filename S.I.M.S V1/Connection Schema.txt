Power and Ground Layout on Breadboard
 
Plug ESP32 on one end of the breadboard.
Connect ESP32 3.3V pin → breadboard red (power) rail.
Connect ESP32 GND pin → breadboard blue (ground) rail.
Power all components (HX711, LCD) from these rails.

Load Cell → HX711 Amplifier

A load cell has 4 wires — usually colored like this (but check yours, colors may vary slightly):
Load Cell Wire	Connects To on HX711	Description
Red	E+	Excitation + (power for load cell)
Black	E-	Excitation - (ground for load cell)
White	A-	Signal - (measurement wire)
Green	A+	Signal + (measurement wire)

make sure that the load cell is screwed in firmly so that 
the flex caused by the actual load is only causing flex in the load cell only
try to avoid stuff which will bend and will take in some part of the weight
it makes the whole system unpredictable ,

HX711 → ESP32

HX711 has two data pins (DT and SCK) and two power pins (VCC, GND).
HX711 Pin	Connects To ESP32 Pin	Description
VCC	3.3V (on ESP32)	Power for HX711
GND	GND (on ESP32)	Ground
DT	GPIO 19	Data signal (matches your code dataPin = 19)
SCK	GPIO 18	Clock signal (matches your code clockPin = 18)

I2C LCD (with backpack) → ESP32

Your LCD uses the I²C protocol (only 4 wires needed).
LCD Pin	Connects To ESP32 Pin	Description
VCC	3.3V (or 5V)*	Power for LCD
GND	GND (on ESP32)	Ground
SDA	GPIO 21	I2C Data line
SCL	GPIO 20	I2C Clock line


also that i have used the serial monitor for log , so
if you are having some issues then serial monitor can provide context to as what might be wrong

also that i have used wifi of the esp32 , so to configure that 
there is a "const char* ssid" , and "const char* password"  , 
which you can conviniently change the things
wifi name in the ssid
and password in password
tip: use 2.4ghz wifi , as 5ghz seems unstable with the esp ,
