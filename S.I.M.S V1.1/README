new features like WiFi handling, better stability detection, smoother scrolling, and refined dose monitoring logic

Introduced WiFi capability for network and NTP time synchronization.

Code tries to reconnect in background.
Same logic but integrated with WiFi sync.

Prevents false detections from vibration/noise.
Compares initial and final weight to check correctness.
Cancels dose session if no action taken.


Automatically tares when weight stable and near zero.
Used to detect when the scale is stable.    
Auto-tare now prints debug messages with measured weight

Generate and scroll long text seamlessly.
